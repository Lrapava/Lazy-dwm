# usable-dwm
A fork of Suckless's Dynamic Window Manager 6.2 with some common patches applied.

Because of Suckless's limitation in 2000 SLOC, DWM is not that usable out of the box and many users have to apply the same patches to get the functionality they want. We have applied some common patches you would probably apply anyways to save you some time!

List of patches applied:

* actualfullscreen
* alpha
* cfacts
* cyclelayouts
* fadeinactive
* fullgaps
* movestack
* systray
